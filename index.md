# Robotic Arm System with Computer Vision for Colour Object Sorting 

A robot (6DOF) with a camera module can respond to objects of different colors using Image processing technique and developing code in Python, then grip and sort them depending on the colour identification. IR sensors are used for pallet presence during object is loading and if it is overloaded, Events will regenerate in QT Software through serial communication. Identification of colours are using Machine Vision Concept Such HSV for colour selection, Erosion for removing white specks, Dilatation for removing black Specks, Hough transformer using for identification object. Robot Arm is designed in such a way that optimizes the area utilization within the working envelope. Forward kinematics method of DH parameters used for end effector desired position. Robot arm controlled by Arduino Mega and Image processing and GUI using Raspberry -PI 3 Model.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
